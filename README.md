# MATLAB PCA & Naive Bayes Implementations

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for two key assignments:

1. **Principal Component Analysis on Handwritten Digits** – visualizing raw
   digit vectors, computing the sample mean and covariance submatrix, extracting
   top eigenvalues/vectors, projecting data into 2D, plotting the digit cloud,
   and measuring average reconstruction error.

1. **Naive Bayes Text Classifier** – estimating class priors, building a
   bag-of-words model, computing class-conditional and posterior probabilities,
   evaluating classifier performance, and exploring the effect of training
   sample size.
